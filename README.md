Exploring data for Progressive Resistance Exercise for PD


# Questions
1. At 24 months (timept 5), what drives the changes observed in the UPDRS?
   Another way of putting it – what variables are associated with the change in
UPDRS at 24 months?

2. Which sub score of the UPDRS manifested the greatest change at 24 months,
   and what variables are associated with the change in this particular sub
score?

3. In the progressive resistance exercise group what are some of the common
   baseline characteristics of those who responded positively to the resistance
training program at 24 months– the point of this question is that if I were a
clinician recognizing these characteristics in a patient will help me prescribe
resistance training for these patients. A related question is what are the
characteristics of those who do not respond to resistance training
